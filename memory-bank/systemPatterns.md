# System Patterns

**System Architecture:**

-   The library consists of Go code that defines functions and methods for creating and manipulating HTML elements.
-   It utilizes a fluent interface pattern for chaining method calls.
-   It supports conditional rendering of elements and attributes based on boolean conditions.

**Key Technical Decisions:**

-   Using Go's built-in HTML escaping mechanism to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
-   Providing tag shortcuts for common HTML elements to reduce code verbosity.
-   Implementing a flexible attribute setting mechanism that allows for both static and dynamic values.

**Design Patterns:**

-   Fluent Interface: The library uses a fluent interface to allow for chaining method calls, making the code more readable and concise.
-   Conditional Rendering: The library supports conditional rendering of elements and attributes based on boolean conditions.

**Component Relationships:**

-   The core component is the `Tag` struct, which represents an HTML element.
-   Tag methods are used to set attributes, add children, and generate HTML output.
-   Utility functions provide additional functionality, such as transforming slices of data into HTML elements.
